# GROUP-4-MLBB
This project provides insights and analytics on the statistics of various MLBB heroes, exploring key trends and applying machine learning techniques to enhance gameplay strategies.

Pages
- Dataset - Brief description of the Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB) dataset used in this dashboard.
- EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis of MLBB dataset. Highlighting the distribution of Primary and Secondary Roles, HP, and Physical Damage. It also highlights the frequency of primary roles. Includes graphs such as - Pie Chart, Histograms, Bar Graphs, Heatmaps, and Boxplots
- Data Cleaning / Pre-processing - Data cleaning and pre-processing steps such as replacing null values in the Secondary Roles column into strings.
- Machine Learning - Training two supervised classification models: Supervised Learning and Random Forest Regressor.
- Prediction - Prediction page where users can input values to predict the the primary role of the hero based on the input features using the trained models.
- Conclusion - Summary of the insights and observations from the EDA and model training.
