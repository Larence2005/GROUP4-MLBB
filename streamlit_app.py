First the **sepal length** averages *5.84 cm* with a standard deviation of *0.83* which indicates moderate variation around the mean. **Sepal width** on the other hand has a lower mean of *3.05* cm and shows less spread with a standard deviation of *0.43*, this indicates that the values of sepal width are generally more consistent. Moving on with **petal length** and **petal width**, these columns show greater variability with means of *3.76 cm* and *1.20 cm* and standard deviation of *1.76* and *0.76*. This suggests that these dimansions vary more significantly across the species.  

    Speaking of minimum and maximum values, petal length ranges from *1.0 cm* up to *6.9 cm*, petal width from *0.1 cm* to *2.5 cm* suggesting that there's a distinct difference between the species.  

    The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles on the other hand reveals a gradual increase across all features indicating that the dataset offers a promising potential to be used for classification techniques.

    This histogram plots the distribution of HP values with a superimposed kernel density estimate (the blue line) to give 
    a representation of the data's frequency. The distribution is right-skewed, meaning it has a longer tail on the higher end of the 
    HP scale. Note most values cluster between 2,250 and 3,000. It shows an apparent peak around 2,500â€“2,750. Characters that have very low HP, 
    about 1,000â€“1,250 are relatively few. Thus, there seems to be a 
    pattern where the game or system design does keep most characters' HP in some kind of "sweet spot" near 2,500, while higher or lower values seem less common.
